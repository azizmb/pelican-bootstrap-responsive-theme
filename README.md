# Pelica Bootstrap Rresponsive Theme #

Theme for [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/) based on
an
[existing Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/93db6c30979e16d99c83fd6139d919a57f8d316d/bootstrap)

Apart from some design changes, I've updated the old theme to use the
latest version of Bootstrap, and have also added the CSS and JS
requried to make is responsive.

## ToDo ##

* Update older partials to use new partial name format, ie prepend
  `_`.
  
* Better implementation of `about_me`.

	Currently this is customised by updating a template. Needs to be
	moved to the conf, or extracted as a `plugin`
